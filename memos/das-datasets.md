# A Guide to Open Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) Datasets

Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) is a technology that transforms a standard fiber optic cable into a dense array of thousands of individual vibration sensors.

Imagine a long glass fiber. A special device called an interrogator sends pulses of laser light down this fiber. As the light travels, tiny natural imperfections in the glass scatter a small amount of light back towards the interrogator. When the fiber is perfectly still, this pattern of backscattered light is stable.

However, if the fiber is stretched or compressed at any point‚Äîeven by a microscopic amount‚Äîit changes the timing and phase of the light that is scattered back from that point. The interrogator measures these changes with extreme precision.

### What is the Connection to Pressure Sensing?

DAS measures **strain**, not pressure. It can only detect if the fiber itself is being stretched or squeezed.

Pressure waves cause strain. A pressure wave, like a seismic wave from an earthquake or a sound wave from a whale traveling through the ground or water, causes the surrounding material (rock, soil, water) to compress and expand.

The strain is transferred to the cable. If the fiber optic cable is well-coupled to its environment (e.g., buried in the seafloor), the compression and expansion of the surrounding material will squeeze and stretch the cable along with it.

Therefore, DAS senses a pressure wave by measuring its effect‚Äîthe strain it induces on the fiber optic cable. Scientists can then analyze this strain data to infer the properties of the original pressure wave, effectively using the entire fiber optic cable as a long, continuous line of pressure sensors.

## Underwater DAS Datasets

This document provides a curated list of publicly available Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) datasets from various projects around the world. These datasets are invaluable resources for research in seismology, oceanography, urban monitoring, geohazards, and more.
