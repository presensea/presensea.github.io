## About The Project

**PRESENSEA** is a research project developing innovative solutions for underwater sea monitoring. Based at the Centre for Biorobotics at Tallinn University of Technology, our work focuses on using arrays of passive, low-cost pressure sensors to listen to the underwater environment.

The core challenge we address is the "cocktail party problem" of the sea: the underwater world is filled with a cacophony of pressure signals from natural sources (waves, currents) and human-induced dynamics (ships, construction). Our goal is to develop advanced algorithms that can separate these signals, allowing us to identify and monitor individual sources with unprecedented clarity. This technology has wide-ranging applications, from environmental monitoring and pollution detection to coastal engineering and marine safety.

## Current Status (as of June 2025)

The project has just started! We are in the initial phase, laying the groundwork for the exciting research ahead.

* **üîú Work Package 1: Dataset** - Upcoming
    * We are currently preparing for our first data collection campaigns in the Baltic Sea.
    * This involves adjusting the existing sensor array to meet the project's specific needs.

* **üóìÔ∏è Work Package 2: Modeling** - Planned
    * Initial physical models will be developed in parallel with data collection.

* **üóìÔ∏è Work Package 3: Algorithms** - Planned
    * Algorithm design will commence once a foundational dataset is established.

* **üóìÔ∏è Work Package 4: Validation** - Planned
    * Final experimental validation is scheduled for the later stages of the project.

## Key Objectives

1.  **Dataset:** Collect a comprehensive dataset using pressure sensor arrays in diverse scenarios and sea conditions.
2.  **Model:** Create simulations and emulations of hydrodynamic pressure signals based on physical models and experimental data.
3.  **Algorithm:** Design and develop a library of real-time algorithms for source separation, detection, and localization.
4.  **Validation:** Test and demonstrate the capabilities of the developed algorithms in real-world autonomous deployments.
